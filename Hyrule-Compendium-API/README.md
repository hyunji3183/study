## Concept
The Hyrule compendium is an encyclopedia of all the in-game interactive items in the world of Hyrule. With this brilliant API, you can access its data and embed it into your own application. 

You can see a specific item, all items in a category, or all data in our database.
Here is an example request and response, retrieving data on the white-maned lynel:

    $ curl https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/entry/white-maned_lynel
    {
        "data": {
            "name": "white-maned lynel",
            "id": 123,
            "category": "monsters",
            "description": "These fearsome monsters have lived in Hyrule since ancient times. Their ability to breathe fire makes White-Maned Lynels among the toughest of the species; each one of their attacks is an invitation to the grave. There are so few eyewitness accounts of this breed because a White-Maned Lynel is not one to let even simple passersby escape with their lives.",
            "common_locations":[
                "Hyrule Field",
                "Hebra Mountains"
            ]
            "drops": [
                "lynel horn",
                "lynel hoof",
                "lynel guts"
            ],
            "image": "https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v2/entry/white-maned_lynel/image"
        }
    }
